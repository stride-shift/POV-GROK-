**Background Context (Use this to inform the summary and takeaways):**
{background_context}

**Instructions for the Sections to Generate:**

--- [Assume a rule precedes this section in the final document] ---

## **Summary & Strategic Integration of All {num_outcomes} Outcomes**
    - Synthesize the overall strategic narrative emerging from the (implied) {num_outcomes} outcomes.
    - **Use numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, etc.) for the main integration points.**
    - **Ensure EACH numbered point is followed by a detailed, analytical paragraph** providing strategic guidance and rationale, **tailored to {target_customer_name}'s overall business context**. Explain how the combined impact of addressing these outcomes repositions {target_customer_name} competitively. Connect the dots between individual outcomes to highlight synergistic effects. Articulate the overarching value proposition at a strategic level.

--- [Ensure rule used before Key Takeaways] ---

## **Key Takeaways & Next Steps**
    - Distill the most critical insights and actionable recommendations.
    - **Use bullet points (`-` or `*`) for the main takeaways.**
    - **Ensure EACH bullet point is followed by a detailed, analytical paragraph** articulating the strategic value, positioning, collaboration needs, or empowerment focus, **all within the context of {target_customer_name}**. Focus on actionable next steps, potential implementation considerations, and how to maintain momentum. Frame the key benefits in executive-level language.

**Formatting Requirements:**
*   Use **Markdown H2 (`##`)** for the two main section titles, bolded (`**...**`).
*   Use numbered lists/bullet points as specified above.
*   Ensure each point is followed by a detailed analytical paragraph.
*   Maintain a highly professional, strategic, and authoritative tone. Use **clear, accessible language that remains professional and strategic**.
*   Start the output directly with `## **Summary & Strategic Integration...**`. Do not include any introductory text before this heading. Include the `---` separator between the two sections as shown.

**Output:**
Return *only* the markdown for these two final sections, formatted exactly as specified.
